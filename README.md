# Text from audio
Using whisper to convert audio to text, mainly transcribing the podcast episodes. Its super basic at the moment. We also track languages, processing time and the actual text from the audio.
Sample output format - 

{
    "language": "english",
    "text": " Hey guys it's John Doe. Nice to meet you all. How are you guys doing? I hope you have a great weekend and loads of fun and some good food.",
    "processing_time": "0:00:03"
}
